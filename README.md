#  CS4782-Final -- Implementing Image2StyleGAN++: How to Edit the Embedded Images?
## Introduction 
The goal of this project is to reimplement the main contributions of the paper Image2StyleGAN++: How to Edit the Embedded Images.   
This paper focuses on improving upon the existing Image2StyleGAN framework—an image editing framework. The improved version, Image2StyleGAN++, introduces three main contributions:  
1. Optimize noise separately from optimizing the latent space.  
2. Use the global latent space (W⁺) to make local edits with masks on images.  
3. Combine W⁺ embedding with activation tensors.

We implement these three contributions along with applications highlighted in the paper. 

## Chosen Result 
Each of three contributions in the paper had different results which we aimed to recreate. 

Contribution 1:   
In contribution 1, the paper prosed optimizing the moise seperatly from the latent space. With this, they aimed to get a higher PSNR value than the original Image2StyleGan framework. They were able to achieve a result of 45 db for the psnr. 

Contribution 2:
