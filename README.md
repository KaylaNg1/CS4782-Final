Image2StyleGAN++: How to Edit the Embedded Images?
Introduction 
The goal of this project is to reimplement the main contributions of the paper Image2StyleGAN++: How to Edit the Embedded Images. 
This paper focuses on improving upon the existing Image2StyleGAN framework—an image editing framework. The improved version, Image2StyleGAN++, introduces three main contributions:
1. Optimize noise separately from optimizing the latent space.
2. Use the global latent space (W⁺) to make local edits with masks on images.
3. Combine W⁺ embedding with activation tensors.
